This section covers various internal portions of IXM. Effectively, this is
the "black magic" section of the documentation. Regardless, if it is in this
section, it is documented so that users can depend on its behavior even
though they will rarely (if ever) interact with the underlying
implementation, unless they are extending IXM themselves.
